### Task Estimaition

For Story points in the Sprint Backlog I used a points system between 1 and 5 to determine the size and difficulty of each task. 1 being the easiest the 5 being the most difficult. Any task that was a 5 would be broken down into smaller sub tasks, for example developing the code for this project woud have been a 5, but breaking it down into smaller blocks got each task down into a 1 or 2 point task. The tasks with 2 are more difficult than the tasks with 1 as they also involve developing tests for the code implemented.
